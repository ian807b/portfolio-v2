# Ian Hwang's Education

## Simon Fraser University (SFU)
- **Degree**: Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
- **Period**: 2021 - 2026 (Expected)
- **Location**: Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada
- **GPA**: 3.12
- **Status**: One semester remaining after current co-op term

**Academic Context:**
Ian's academic journey has been marked by significant resilience. After relocating to Canada following his father's passing, he navigated the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic during which he experienced a personal loss (miscarriage at 17 weeks). More recently, he experienced the passing of his grandmother and uncle, while also supporting his mother in South Korea. Despite these profound challenges, Ian has maintained his commitment to completing his degree with just one semester remaining. His GPA reflects this difficult period, but his determination to finish while gaining valuable co-op experience demonstrates strong character and perseverance.

## Relevant Coursework
Ian has completed a broad range of computer science courses at SFU:

- **Data Structures & Algorithms**: Fundamental CS concepts, algorithm analysis, and problem solving.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Design patterns, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism.
- **Web Development**: Modern web technologies, client-server architecture, full-stack development.
- **Software Engineering**: Software development lifecycle, agile methodologies, team collaboration.
- **Database Systems**: Relational database design, SQL, normalization, query optimization.
- **Networking**: Computer networks, protocols, TCP/IP, network security.
- **Distributed Systems**: Distributed computing concepts, consistency models, fault tolerance.
- **Embedded Systems**: Low-level programming, hardware-software interface, real-time systems.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: AI fundamentals, search algorithms, machine learning basics.
- **Bioinformatics**: Computational biology, sequence analysis, biological data processing.
