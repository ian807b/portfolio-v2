- Optimized application throughput by profiling with PIX to identify database bottlenecks and implementing concurrent solutions
- Reduced lock contention by minimizing mutex hold time—redesigned database query threading to make the application as non-blocking as possible
- Used Visual Studio with ReSharper for development, advanced debugging with breakpoints, and performance profiling

*Data Processing & Systems Integration*
- Developed efficient data processing pipelines to handle large ultrasound datasets, utilizing serialization to structure PostgreSQL data for UI workflows
- Increased data transfer speed up to 5x faster from embedded systems to local machines by removing redundant data chunks

*DevOps & Observability*
- Built observability infrastructure using AWS for backend process automation and PostgreSQL database management
