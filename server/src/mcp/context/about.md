## What Makes Ian Stand Out

### 1. Exceptional Learning Ability
Ian's greatest strength is his ability to rapidly learn new technologies and adapt to unfamiliar domains. At DarkVision, he quickly mastered a highly niche industry (inline inspection of oil wells using acoustic imaging/ultrasound technology) and the company's entirely in-house technology stack—from Windows applications to embedded systems. This learning agility is his superpower.

### 2. Production Windows Application Development
Currently developing high-performance C++20 Windows desktop applications at DarkVision, used by data analysts and field operators. Experience with profiling (PIX), optimizing database interactions, implementing concurrent solutions (Mutex, std::async, thread management), and processing large ultrasound datasets. Uses Visual Studio with ReSharper, advanced debugging with breakpoints, and modern C++ features (smart pointers, move semantics, STL, templates).

### 3. Problem-Solving Motivation
Ian is driven by a deep desire to solve problems and help others. This motivation stems from personal experiences and a genuine enjoyment of tackling challenges. He chose software engineering specifically for its versatility and the ability to create impactful solutions at any scale.

### 4. Systems & Full-Stack Versatility
- **Systems Programming**: Deep C++20 expertise with embedded systems (BeagleBone), I2C protocol, sensor integration, real-time threading
- **Full-Stack Development**: React, Express.js, PostgreSQL, AWS (EC2, RDS, Cognito), Terraform exposure
- **DevOps & Observability**: Built production monitoring pipelines with Prometheus/Grafana

### 5. Startup Mindset & Leadership
- Thrives in dynamic, fast-paced environments with high ownership
- Currently building a travel mobile app with 8 SFU peers operating like a startup (NDA, role division, cross-functional collaboration)
- Led an amateur baseball team as captain for 5 years (elected as an outsider, maintained leadership across diverse team)
- Consistently initiates and leads group projects (Running Tracker, Smart Stick capstone)

### 6. Resilience & Determination
Ian has demonstrated remarkable resilience throughout his academic journey. After relocating to Canada following his father's passing, navigating the COVID-19 pandemic, and experiencing significant family losses, he maintained his commitment to completing his degree. His GPA of 3.12 reflects this challenging period, but his determination to finish with one semester remaining—while gaining valuable co-op experience—demonstrates strong character and perseverance.

## Career Change Story
Ian transitioned to software engineering from roles in translation (Changjo Law Firm) and international investment (Korea Venture Investment Corporation). These previous roles, while valuable, felt repetitive and lacked opportunities for personal growth. After significant life reflection, Ian decided to pursue a field that aligned with his passion for problem-solving and creativity. He was accepted to both UBC's Electrical/Computer Engineering and SFU's Computer Science programs, ultimately choosing Computer Science for its versatility and the ability to work on projects ranging from solo efforts to large-scale collaborations.

## Awards & Recognition
- **The Army Commendation/Achievement Medals** (Sep. 2010 & Jul. 2011): Recognized for key role in ROK/US joint investigation of the Cheonan naval vessel sinking.
- **#1 Soldier**: Selected as top soldier in brigade-wide competition evaluating combat skills, physical performance, and professional conduct.

## Personality & Work Style
- Detail-oriented and quality-focused
- Enjoys solving complex technical problems
- Values clean, maintainable code
- Collaborative team player with leadership experience
- Eager to learn and grow in a professional environment
